                        The objective of the project is the creation of a
                        <b>thermal bath building</b>, or <b>hotspot</b>, in
                        Reykjavik, Iceland. It will take into account both the
                        problematic <b>climate</b> of this location, and the
                        lack of <b>light</b> due to the short duration of the
                        days, as well as the contrast in
                        <b>temperature</b> between inside and outside.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To this end, it was decided to operate in the shape of a
                        <b>tower</b>, dividing the project in two parts: a great
                        square <b>base</b> that will house the uses of
                        reception, changing rooms and cafeteria, all wrapped in
                        an opaque <b>GRC</b> skin; and a series of
                        <b>out-of-phase platforms</b> that will contain the
                        pools, these in turn, wrapped in a <b>glass</b> skin
                        that will allow light to enter from any point.

                        The small city of Godoy Cruz belongs to the province of
                        Mendoza (Argentina). It is characterized by its
                        <strong>low altitude</strong>, in
                        <strong>contrast</strong> with the great
                        <strong>mountain range</strong> of the Andes and its
                        enormous peak, the Aconcagua, next to which it is
                        located.

                    <p>
                        A <strong>residential</strong> project is proposed as an
                        <strong>analogy</strong> to the mountain and river
                        landscape, which is why this area stands out so much. A
                        great <strong>cross</strong> is designed in which the
                        <strong>houses</strong> at different heights will
                        simulate the <strong>mountain range</strong>, and a
                        <strong>linear fluvial park</strong> will join the lower
                        public pedestrian areas simulating the
                        <strong>rivers</strong> of Argentina.

                        The <strong>Auditorium</strong> in Parque Juan Carlos I
                        in Madrid was closed in 2008 and has remained
                        <strong>abandoned</strong> ever since. Eleven years
                        later, the <strong>water</strong> is not flowing. The
                        <strong>lights</strong> no longer dance. The
                        <strong>music</strong> stopped playing long ago. There
                        is no more <strong>performance</strong>. Everything has
                        <strong>changed</strong>.

                        With this project, the building is proposed to be

                        masts and more than 130 metres of textile membrane are
                        intended to refurbish the place for future
                        <strong>open-air</strong> shows.

                            Porto. Rain, cold. November 26th, 2019. An early
                            morning dense fog takes time to dissipate due to the
                            low temperature and high humidity of the
                            environment. The water keeps falling from the sky.
                            The ground is flooding. It gets muddy. It changes.
                            <strong>Puddles</strong> have taken over the
                            landscape.

                        The random <strong>landscape of wetlands</strong> that
                        emerges due to the high probability of
                        <strong>precipitation</strong> in Porto is at least one
                        of the most interesting
                        <strong>spatial situations</strong> that Parque da
                        Cidade has. But, what if the
                        <strong>topography</strong> could be
                        <strong>modified</strong> in such a way that the puddles
                        always appear in the <strong>same place</strong>? What
                        if, at the same time,
                        <strong>rainwater runoff</strong> could be controlled so
                        that it always falls where it
                        <strong>interests</strong> us?

                        More than <strong>50,000</strong> square meters of thin

                        differences in elevation on an
                        <strong>irregular</strong> topography full of water and
                        vegetation will give rise to unique
                        <strong>temperature</strong> differences and
                        <strong>air flows</strong> depending on where we are
                        and, as a consequence, to a series of natural
                        <strong>microclimates</strong> throughout the area.

                        As if it were an

                        <strong>splashes of the waves</strong> towards the
